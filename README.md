[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bruno-barros/w.eloquent-framework.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bruno-barros/w.eloquent-framework)

Wordpress integrated with Laravel via Composer.

#### Documentation is being building on [wiki page](https://github.com/bruno-barros/w.eloquent/wiki).

### Goals
Run `composer install` and have a system in place with:

- Wordpress as front and back-end
- Laravel as API and front-and (if necessary)
- Install Wordpress and plugins via composer
- Keeping plugins and themes for Wordpress environment as it is 
- Access to Laravel API, including Facades, inside Wordpress
- Access Wordpress API inside Laravel
